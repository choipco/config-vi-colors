# config-vi-colors

1.) clone the repo at the root
2.) mv the contents of VIM folder which will be cloned repo from step 1, move them into your ~/.vim directory as child folders
3.) you basically swapped out VIM for .vim in your local environment
4.) then use unix command source to 'source ~/.vimrc' which should work to redo your vi colors
5.) note that your .vimrc file might need some cleanup across environments, so a standard version should be put to this project
