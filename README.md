# config-vi-colors

+ clone the repo at the root
+ mv the contents of VIM folder which will be cloned repo from step 1, move them into your ~/.vim directory as child folders

+ then use unix command source to 'source ~/.vimrc' which should work to redo your vi colors
+ note that your .vimrc file might need some cleanup across environments, so a standard version should be put to this project
